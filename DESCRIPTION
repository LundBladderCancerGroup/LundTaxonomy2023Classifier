Description: The packages implements a Random Forest rule-based single-sample predictor that classifies 
    transcriptomic samples into the 5 (or 7, including subclasses) Lund Taxonomy molecular subtypes. 
    The final classifier is composed of two separate predictors applied sequentially - first a sample 
    is classified as one of the 5 main classes (Uro, GU, BaSq, Mes or ScNE), and then samples classified as
    Uro are subclassified into UroA, UroB or UroC by a second predictor.
