#' the 5 main Lund Taxonomy molecular subtypes, Uro, GU, BaSq, Mes, or ScNE
#' Object includes the final RF classifier, the used genes and rules in the final model,
#' the Boruta results, and the training matrix. The training matrix is a binary matrix
#' containing the rule values for the training data and it is used for
#' imputation purposes during the prediction if values are missing in the sample.

#'
#' This packages implements a Random Forest rule-based single-sample predictor that classifies
#' transcriptomic samples into the 5 (or 7, including subclasses) Lund Taxonomy molecular subtypes.
#' The final classifier is composed of two separate predictors applied sequentially: first a sample
#' is classified as one of the 5 main classes (Uro, GU, BaSq, Mes or ScNE), and then samples classified as
#' Uro are subclassified into UroA, UroB or UroC by a second predictor
